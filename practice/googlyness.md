In your internship you have worked with other people, was there a time when you had conflicting persectives with your teammates. how did you handled that.
Were your suggestions considered?
Have you worked upon something which has very strict deadlines, how did you manage it
If you are working on a project with 4 other people and everyone has contributed equally but one person takes all the credits what will you do
do you think it will affect his relationship with you or with the other teammates.
Then he asked if I had any questions, I aksed him few questions
Feedback: exact words of Hr: "It was between okay and good, consider it a positive" (I guess lean hire or hire)
